      I initially started my undergraduate education at
      &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://franklincollege.edu/&quot;&gt;Franklin College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Fall of
      2012 as a Computer Science major. Franklin College is located just South
      of Indianapolis, Indiana, and is the hometown I grew up in for 20 years.
      However, after two years I transferred to the
      &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://usfsm.edu/&quot;&gt;University of South Florida Sarasota- 
       Manatee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Fall of 2015 in order to be closer to my parents who had 
       moved around the area themselves a year prior. Unfortunately, they did not 
       have a Computer Science major, but instead a general IT major with various 
       concentrations.
&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      With that being the case, it took me all summer to find a proper developer
      job - and when I wasn&apos;t looking for jobs, I was learning, coding, and doing all
      I could to fill in the missing gaps in order to land such a job. Luckily
      when it rains it pours, and during a one week span in August of 2018 I was
      offered three jobs. One as a PHP developer, the second as an intern to
      full-time C#/.NET developer, and the final one as a Application Support
      Analyst role with J&amp;amp;J. I ended taking up the position with J&amp;amp;J.
      While it was not a developer role, I could not pass up on the chance to
      work with such a great company and work my way towards such a role.
