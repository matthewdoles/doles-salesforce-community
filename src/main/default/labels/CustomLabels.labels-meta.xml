      I initially started my undergraduate education at
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://franklincollege.edu/&quot;&gt;Franklin College&lt;/a&gt; in Fall of
      2012 as a Computer Science major. Franklin College is located in Indiana,
      and Franklin itself is the small town just South of Indianapolis I grew up
      in. However, after two years I transferred to the
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://usfsm.edu/&quot;&gt;University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee&lt;/a&gt;
      in Fall of 2015 in order to be closer to my parents that had moved to the
      area themselves a year prior. Unfortunately, they did not have a Computer
      Science major. However, the program still offered me the education and
      tools needed to pursue a career path in the general IT field.
 &lt;/p&gt;</value>

      The only downside is I wanted to pursue a career path in development or
      engineering. Having graduated in Spring of 2018, I spent the majority of
      that summer looking for a job, and when I wasn&apos;t doing that I was
      learning, coding, and filling in the missing gaps so I could land a job as
      a developer. Luckily when it rains it pours, and during a one week span in
      August of 2018 I was offered three jobs. One as a PHP developer, the second
      as an intern to full-time C#/.NET developer, and the final one being the
      Application Support Analyst with J&amp;amp;J. I ended taking up the position with 
      J&amp;amp;J as I could not  pass up on the chance to work with such a great company 
      and work my way towards a developer role.
