Although COVID-19 delayed that process quite a bit in 2020, I eventually transitioned into a Senior Salesforce Developer position by July of 2021. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">﻿Johnson and Johnson boasts a healthy portfolio of Salesforce instances. Thus, the great opportunity about working for them is that there are a wide array of projects to get into within the various sectors of J&amp;J. However, the responsibilities and day-to-day work does not vary wildy as most project teams work in an agile framework to deliver business requested features within a given iteration. While being a good developer is helpful, J&amp;J also places great value in effective communication. This can range from the abilty to relay roadblocks in current devlopment during standup, contributing to the technical design of a story in refinement, or framing demos appropriately to a non-technical audience. I have developed and continue to grow these skills having served on the following projects:</span></p>"

Technology Services at J&amp;J can be split up into two sectors: BUILD and RUN. This role was within the RUN sector. Furthermore, the RUN sector can be split up even further into various clusters with varying technology specialties. The cluster I served on was called Customer &amp; Sales which specializes primarily in Salesforce technology. The application portfolio boasts over 30 unique Salesforce instances. Each of these Salesforce applications are owned by a Johnson and Johnson business, and the day-to-day support activities that may be required for these applications are done by a 3rd-party vendor (Cognizant for Customer &amp; Sales). Thus, the RUN team serves as a liaison between the owning-business and the vendor.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Since these support activites are done by contractors, I seldomly found myself within a Salesforce instance doing actual support. However, I often did help triage incident tickets submitted by varios application users through an internal ticketing tool developed by J&amp;J called IRIS. Thus, my understanding of Salesforce is being applied and growing every day to help mitigate issues.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While that broadly covers some of the day-to-day duties, I was also responsible for several long-term projects and goals:</span></p>"
