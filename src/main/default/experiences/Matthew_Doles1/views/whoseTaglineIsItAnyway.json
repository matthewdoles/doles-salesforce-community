The idea of building custom Alexa skills intrigued me. I completed a few of the Trailhead modules, but I had a taste for more. So I went to Udemy and bought an Alexa development course by Vivek Kapoor called&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-rad-personal-assistant-with-amazon-alexa-custom-skills/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>Practical Hands-on Guide for Amazon Alexa Skill Development</b></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">. This course provided me the fundamentals I needed to start building custom Alexa Skills from scratch.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">After completing the course, the first Alexa skill I built was&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://github.com/matthewdoles/alfred-alexa-skill\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>Alfred</b></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;which is my own personal voice voice assistant. One of the highlights of Alfred I developed was the ability for it to read my latest tweet out loud by leveraging&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>Twitter for Node.js</b></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;to retrieve and read my latest tweet. Furthermore, I've added logic to customize Alfred's response based upon the number of times the tweet was favorited. This particular experiment consuming the Twitter API is then what inspired me to create Whose Tagline Is It Anyway.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Whose Tagline Is It Anyway is a movie trivia Alexa skill with two games. In the primary self-titled game (Whose Tagline Is It Anyway), you must guess which movie a random movie tagline belongs to from a pool of over 1,500+ popular movies. The second game is called Good Word Hunting. At the start of the game you are given up to 7 keywords that describe a movie from the same pool of 1,500+ popular movies. With those keywords, you must reply with how many names from lowest to highest billed you would need to guess what the movie may be. After being given the requested number of names, you then give your guess.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">To develop Whose Tagline Is It Anyway I used the standard Alexa Skills Kit to design the voice interaction, and developed a Lambda function to handle the intent invocation as defined in my voice interaction. The runtime language of my Lambda function is Node.js. As for retrieving movie information, I am making callouts to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>The Movie Database (TMDb)</b></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;which offers a free public API. TMBb has almost half a million of movies cataloged. Luckily, I can define parameters in my callouts to only query for semi-popular movies using filters like the number of times the movie was rated. However, if you wanted to get the movie tagline or movie cast for a specific movie, voice intents are available for the user to do so.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Additionally, the Good Word Hunting game is an entitlement. Meaning that you pay a one time fee ($1) to own the right to play the game. Configuring this option was easily the hardest part of the project. When you start asking the user to pay money, the Amazon Alexa skill team will thoroughly test that your skill works as intended and everything is working as intended. Wile it took a few times to make my skill compliant, I found satisfaction in the revision process and working towards a nice polished product. While the monetary transaction is handled by Amazon themselves, a bit of code configuration was needed to ensure that the user wasn't able to access Good Word Hunting when not entitled, and then the opposite when they were.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Repository: </span><a href=\"https://github.com/matthewdoles/whose-tagline-is-it-anyway\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://github.com/matthewdoles/whose-tagline-is-it-anyway</b></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Amazon Store Page:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Whose-Tagline-Is-It-Anyway/dp/B07SW6MZLZ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://www.amazon.com/Whose-Tagline-Is-It-Anyway/dp/B07SW6MZLZ</b></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
