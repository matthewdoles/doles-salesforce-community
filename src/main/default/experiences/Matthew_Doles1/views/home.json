I grew up in Indiana the first 20 years of my life, and currently reside in Tampa, FL. I am a pretty avid sports fan. I played baseball and golf growing up, and still play golf regualry to this day. However, I enjoy watching sports as much as I do playing them. I am particullary fond of Chicago sports teams such as the Cubs, Blackhawks, Bears, and Bulls. Going over to my grandparents house during summer afternoons to eat PB&amp;J and watch the Cubs are some of my favorite childhood memories. Like most guys in their twenties that are in this field, I do also enjoy playing video games. However, what I most enjoy about them is that they have been a great outlet to keep connected with my friends I still have back in Indiana. I'm hardly a chef, but I do enjoy cooking and even more so eating. I would probably have to say I love Thai food the most, but I will try just about anything once. Outside of that, my typical post-work&nbsp;day includes exercising, reading, and even working on side-projects such as this very site here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
