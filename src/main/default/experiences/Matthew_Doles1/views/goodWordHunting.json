The game itself can be played solo or with friends with the ability to apply various filters and difficulties. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">The original design and flow of the game goes like this:</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">The player is given up to 10 words related to a randomly fetched piece of media (tv or movie).</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">Given the keywords, the player is then asked from lowest billed to highest how many cast members they would need to guess the movie (up to 10 members, rare occurrences&nbsp;cast may be less).</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">After selecting a number, the given cast members are listed and the user uses the collective information to then guess the title of the movie or tv show.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">On certain difficulties, the user can optionally request a hint where 8 total options will be shown: 7 similar and 1 correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">After giving a guess, the guess and answer are along with all the keywords and cast (w/ pictures).</span></li></ol><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">To help enhance the game, the filters page provides the ability for the user to apply various filters such as media type (movie or tv), the genre of the media, and metrics related to the popularity of the media such as the rating and number of reviews it has. Whenever the user adjusts any of these filters, the pool size is calculated and updated based on their selected filters. The next time the player starts a new game, a random piece of media will be fetched based on the provided selections. Default filters are also provided as to avoid fetching an obscure piece of media. There are 4 selectable difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Impossible. Descriptions of each can be found on the filters each, and likewise the next time a user starts a game the selected difficulty setting will be applied.</span></p><h4><br></h4><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">The ability to play multiplayer is enabled and managed using&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://socket.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">Socket.io</a><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">. This was my first venture into using WebSocket based technology. While it was extremely frustrating at first, it was really rewarding. The frustration really stemmed from the lack of examples I could find online of Svelte projects (especially SvelteKit) using socket technology. Through trial and discovery, I found that the simplest solution was to setup a </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">separate</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\"> dedicated backend which my Svelte frontend could connect with via the Client API. Setting up a multiplayer game is simple, one user should use the 'Create' option to host a game. That user should then see a lobby code which then can be dispersed to other users who will need said code to enter the lobby using the 'Join' option. The mechanics of the game itself are the same, every player plays the round individually and once all users have answered - everyones results are shown, points are tallied, and the lobby admin/host is delegated to starting the next round when appropriate.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">Website:</span><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> </b><a href=\"https://good-word-hunting.vercel.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://good-word-hunting.vercel.app/</b></a></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">Frontend Repository:</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://github.com/matthewdoles/good-word-hunting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://github.com/matthewdoles/good-word-hunting</b></a></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 16px;\">Backend Repository: </span><a href=\"https://github.com/matthewdoles/good-word-hunting-bakcend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://github.com/matthewdoles/good-word-hunting-bakcend</b></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
