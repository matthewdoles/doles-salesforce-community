The original co-founder of the network, Mathew Muncy, was a mutual friend of mine through my brother. Muncy is a journalist, podcaster, and content creator who has worked in the craft beer industry much of his career. Muncy had built a small following for his (now former) podcast,&nbsp;Barrel Chat, and wanted to build a network platform for similar beer-centric podcasts that would offer cross-promotion and build a community of like-minded beer lovers.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">At the time, Muncy was using WordPress to host all the network's podcasts. While it got the job, Muncy was not satisfied with its point and click WYSIWYG features. If the platform were to grow, he needed a more polished product that could also scale with growth. With the business goal and needs established, I began developing the website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and PHP. It was my first major project that I developed from scratch, and I really had no sense of web design concepts compared to what I know now.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The overall design of the website is pretty straightforward. A home page that displays the 10 most recent episode across allocated podcasts. An about us page that explores the network's beginning, purpose, founders, and instructions on how to join. A podcasts page which listed all the podcasts on the network available for listen. Additionally, every show has its own page that contains a feed of their episodes available for listen, and an audio player to listen directly on the website. Finally, there was a contact page which was a simple form anyone could fill out that would send a message to the network's email address. The only other major feature was the search functionality. Located in the upper right hand corner is a search bar. Typing in any keywords will look for any matching phrases within an episode's description or title and highlight them with bold font.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This project had a couple major barriers I had to climb. The first one was setting up a MySQL database to host all the podcast information. The tricky part here was that we did not want to host the audio files on our website as that can get expensive rather quickly. Thus, I had to create a Cron job that would go through each individual podcast RSS feed, insert any new episodes, and save the url address where the audio file was being hosted. This way, all I have to do is dynamically assign the URL address to the audio player. The second major challenge presented to me was making the website web responsive and intuitive on mobile phones. Muncy had noticed thanks to Google Analytics that over 50% of the site's traffic was from mobile users. Thus, the website needed to render in a mobile friendly format. While accomplishable</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">through CSS media queries, it was quite the undertaking. The whole venture felt like I was making an entirely new project, but I was thankful for the experience as it forced me to become familiar with CSS and web responsiveness concepts.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Muncy and his partner, Dustin Woods, would go on to sell Hopped Up Network. Although the network is still active, I no longer maintain their website. From what I can tell, the design and functionality also appears largely unchanged from my original work. However, I cannot be certain of what changes they have made or plan to make. Out of respect, I have also not made the repository available for public viewing.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;</span></p>"
