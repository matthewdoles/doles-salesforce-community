So, while I was getting acquainted with my new role, my Trailhead journey took a small pause. However, the quest for more certifications came back with a force in late December of 2018 when I began prepping for the Platform App Builder exam by using Trailhead and yet another great</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/salesforce-platform-app-builder/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Mike Wheeler course for Platform App Builder</strong></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">.</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> In fact, I had attempted and passed the exam on Christmas Eve which had made for an extra enjoyable holiday season.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;\">However, I was still not done. I quickly turned around and dedicated myself to earning the Platform Developer I certification.

So as I made that push, I took a shining to the Superbadges as they provide real-world scenarios instead of just walking you through a simple project. Some of my favorite Trailhead material that I really took to dealt with front-end development. In fact, around this time Lighting Web Components (LWC) was trending up - the new and improved alternative to Aura components. Consuming the</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>LWC Recipes</strong></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">was a huge resource to learning LWC; I even made it an exercise to re-program all the components line-by-line to understand their inner wrokrings.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;\">From 2019 into 2020 I eventually made it to double ranger. With 2020 being the year that will notoriously be remembered as one where everyone quarantined,&nbsp;the extra time made it easy to accomplish this goal. In addition, I also set out to get the newly introduced JavaScript Developer I certification. Having already spent a better part of the past year or so (at the time) learning everything JavaScript from LWC to Node to React to etc. I felt adequetly prepared to jump right in and just go for it. The only sort of preparation I did was complete the</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> </span><a href=\"https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_lwc_specialist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Lightning Web Component Specialist</strong></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Superbadge, which I found out afterwards was actually a requirement for earning the certification. The exam itself is one of the most unique Salesforce exams I have taken. In fact, I would say none of it is actually focused on anything Salesforce itself, it is all pure JavaScript. Thus, a good certification for those from a web development backgorund or similar that want to get into Salesforce. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;\">Although it started as an exercise for learning SFDX, I try to do as much Trailhead exercises as possible in my devloper edition org and track it in source control:</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://github.com/matthewdoles/salesforce-dev-doles-dx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"null\" style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><strong>salesforce-doles-dx.</strong></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The first steps were pretty obvious and that was to pursue my Platform App Builder and Platform Developer I certifications. With those in hand, I could I could start getting my feet wet at as a developer on a enterprise level with Johnson and Johnson. On my road to certification, I started to get connected with the Salesforce development team within my office. One of the lead developers,</span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-mason-cloud/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Rick Mason</strong></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">, </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">was very helpful in mentoring, not just me, but any person interested in getting into Salesforce and pursing certifications.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As I started earning some certficiations, I was able to work on some&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of Concept (PoC) projects on the side for J&amp;J thanks to who would be my eventual hiring manager.

Working on such various projects has without a doubt been the biggest bolster to my Salesforce journey. What my Experience page won't show are some of the non-resume benefits of working at Johnson and Johnson. For instance, monthly forums with all J&amp;J Salesforce developers to discuss best practices and showcase any new trending technologies. From technical architects to junior developers, there isn't a single person that doesn't offer something I can learn from.
