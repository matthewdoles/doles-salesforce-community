Valorant itself is a 5v5 first person shooter. Each game of Valorant is played til the first team to win 13 rounds. A round is one by either eliminating the entire opposing team, planting and detonating the spike on offense, or defusing the spike before detonation if on defense. Before the game starts though, each team can select an agent to play as. Each agent having unqiue abilites that can range from </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">a flashbang to a recon bolt that reveals enemies location. Coordination is huge in a team based shooter. On top of that, with such a wide array of agent abilites to utilize, strategy on engaging the enemy team is very important.

Was extra convenient for me as it was around this time most of the nation went into qurantine. Thus, with new abundance of free time, I was able to really commit myself to the project. I was not sure on whether the app would be succesful or not; I more so threw myself into it because I wanted to learn React Native. Plus, I had my friend Donnie Waters around to consult who has had his developed in the framework for his succeful app Rocket League Garage. </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I began development </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">around March 2020. Although the game was not even officially out, it was in open beta which was helpful as it allowed people to observe the game's mechanics, maps, agents, etc. So, I was able to start development before the game was even released.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Android: </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.projectvalorapp\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.projectvalorapp</b></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Apple: </span><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vigilant-valorant-strategy/id1521166919?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vigilant-valorant-strategy/id1521166919?ign-mpt=uo%3D4</b></a></p>"
