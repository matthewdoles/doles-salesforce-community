        The first official project I served on was quite exciting as it was a
        human resources Salesforce community portal which was to be utilized for
        Johnson and Johnson's 100,000+ employees. The previous askGS (GS
        standing for Global Services) portal was a Salesforce Site.com site, and
        entering into 2020 was in need of a overhaul. The Salesforce org as a
        whole has been developed and maintained by our Salesforce pratners in
        Europe (specifically based in Ireland) who themselves have built out
        much of the functionality and features for the new portal. The job of
        myself and a couple other developers based in my office was to implement
        the UI/UX portion of the site. With us focused on the styling, our EMEA
        counterparts could focus on building out the rest of the functionality
        so that the portal could be ready by go-live which was set as January of
        2020.

        The work in general mostly consisted of CSS styling. Salesforce
        communities can be quite amazing in that you could re-design it entirely
        and one wouldn't even recognize that it is Salesforce under the covers.
        Of course, the more you drift away from out of the box styling, the more
        effort required. With the askGS project, a 3rd party UI/UX team designed
        some wireframes that were approved by the business as the final design
        for the site. All in all, the design was nothing to extravagant, it
        mostly followed the look and feel of all J&amp;J specific websites which
        features unqiue branding colors, fonts, and icons. Applying the design
        mostly occured at the component level, and we tried to utilize as little
        needed CSS override as possible. The biggest challenge we faced would
        have had to be accomadting the style to all available languages. As an
        international platform, there were up to 20 available languges to select
        to render the site. With sybmbol based languages like Japanese, Korean,
        and Thai, we had to be extra careful with the word break/wrapping as
        sometimes a translation could become confusing or even sometimes
        offensive.

        After the askGS project and entering the 2020 year, a few co-workers and
        I from the Tampa Development Center were placed into the vision sector
        of Johnson and Johnson. The vision sector has several Salesforce
        instances, each one specific to a region: NA, EMEA, ASPAC, and LATAM.
        While serving on the project, the team primarily worked in the NA and
        EMEA instances.

      <p class="slds-p-vertical_small body-text">
        One of the major features I helped build was a tablet-centric calendar
        using the
        <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/"> FullCalendar</a> framework. The
        vision sector sales users using the org may make up to 8 to 10 sales
        calls/check-ins a day. Since a majority of these meetings are in-person,
        a majority of sales people are issued a iPad for logging their calls in
        Salesforce while traveling. Thus, a much needed enhancement was this
        custom calendar application. While Salesforce offers a calendar out of
        the box, our custom built calendar allows the user to click on an event
        (scheduled call) which pops out a sidebar for them to review their
        pre-meeting notes, get the location address, and log their post-meeting
        notes all in one place. What was very exciting about the work is that
        the team has also stripped down the calendar to its bare functionality
        which allows it to be easily transposed to other Salesforce orgs. Thus,
        any in Johnson and Johnson's portfolio could consume this calendar, and
        alter to their business-specific needs.

        Another major feature we delivered was called coach calling. This
        feature enbles regional managers to create coaching sessions for their
        sales people. For any given account call a sales agent makes in
        Salesforce, a manager can create a coaching session off of that sales
        call. During the meeting a manager is not so much coaching but
        observing, and after the call/meetnig a manager can log their notes and
        ratings into that coaching session. The feature allows sales agents to
        receive feedback, and manager's can accumulate a summary on how well
        sales people are engagaing with their regional accounts. The challenges
        of developing this feture revolved around record security with
        consideration of the territory hierarchy. There were tricky scenarios
        given by the business like sharing and unsharing coaching sessions when
        a sales agent moves to a new territory.

        Due to the circumstances of COVID-19, the vision sector team I was
        supposed to serve on through 2020 cut back a bit. Luckily, I was able to
        find work in Johnson and Johnson's. Medical Devices sector. The primary
        Salesforce org for the sector has many name variations due to the many
        applications on the platform itself. However, when I came onto the team
        I was a part of a new initiative to create a Salesforce Community
        intended to be used by all North America Medical Device employees. The
        drive behind the project was to replace an exisiting technology (Drupal
        site) with a new one (Salesforce), A common trend I started to notice at
        this point.

      <p class="slds-p-vertical_small body-text">
        One of the exciting features that the community would offer out of the
        box that they did not have prior was social engagemnt via Chatter. This
        ability would allow users to ask questions, levae feedback, and
        collaborate with others without having to do it through instant
        messaging or email. The contentin the portal ranges, but one of the
        primary content types is Surgical Techniques. The sales people within
        the Medical Device sector are very unique. Not only are they selling
        medicl devices, but are well-trained licensed surgeons themselves who
        use this content to keep up on the latest updates to surgical techniques
        realted to J&amp;J's wide array of medical devices. The community also
        features Community Events which gives visibility to the various events
        going on within the Medical Device sector and allows users to attend
        them. Other minor features include a quick links tab that lets users see
        a slew of helpful links, and filter them based off keywords.
        Additionally, we leveraged public groups out of the box which allows
        users to join groups based off their specific area of expertise which
        can range from marketing teams to anatomical area experts.
      </p>
      <p class="slds-p-vertical_small body-text">
        Most of the major challenges with the project centered around the
        content management feature. While Salesforce offers a CMS solution, it
        didn not meet the business requirements. We also considered using
        Knowledge which does versioning as needed, but ran into limitations
        around file size limits. Nothing absolutely captured all of the
        requirements, but we found the most control in doint it with a custom
        object. To expand on the requirements, the community has a persona
        called super users; these super users are the ones that are allowed to
        submit content to expose to the whole community. However, if the content
        is something like a Surgical Technique, it needs to be submitted for
        approval to a higher persona called a business admin. Thus, the trickery
        came into creating this approval process, and sharing content with the
        whole community when it is approved and unsharaing it when expired or
        outdated.
