        Key documentation for an application includes a Technical Design
        Specifications (TDS) and an Operations Run Book (ORB). A TDS is created
        by the BUILD team during development, and details the entire inner
        workings and acrchitecture of an application. An ORB further details
        information that may not be covered by a TDS such as points of failures,
        impacted user communities, communication and resolution protocols for
        outages, and comprehensive contact information. When I came onto the
        team and started learning about supporting the cluster's applications, I
        was pointed towards the application's corresponding ORB to learn more
        about supporting any said application. However, we soon realized the
        overall landscape of our cluster's ORBs was in a poor state. Thus, I was
        put in charge of an effort to work with the various support teams to
        help improve the quality of each application's ORB and bring them to our
        baseline standards.

        One of my favorite projects was enabling a service-level targeting tool
        offered by another RUN team cluster (Data &amp; Analytics) called
        Aggrify. This tool captures pertinent metadata about any jobs a
        application may have. We enabled this tool specifically for Scheduled
        Apex classes within our various Salesforce applications. With Aggrify
        enabled, we could monitor for job success and failures, analyze the mean
        time for a job to complete, and troubleshoot possible solutions to make
        the job run more efficiently.

        Whenever a incident ticket is resolved in IRIS, you are required to find
        or create an appropriate Knowledge Article that details the steps taken
        to resolve the issue in order to close the ticket. Over-time you build a
        strong Knowledge Base, and steps to resolve repeated issues can be found
        easily. However, over-time we have found that the vendor had cut
        corners, and created lazy Knowledge Articles that have no sustenance
        whatsoever, and only polluted the Knowledge Base. To help mitigate this
        issue, our cluster created an audit process to randomly select various
        Knowledge Articles created in the prior month and verify the quality of
        their content. If a Knowledge Article does not meet the baseline
        standards, we provided feedback to the original author and they were to
        update it appropriately.

        CopyStorm is a suite of 3rd party tools offered by
        <a href="https://www.capstorm.com/"> CapStorm</a> which allow you to
        backup salesforce data and metadata, and restore it to any environment.
        So, should an application have a major release go awry, you can restore
        a production environment to a previous stable state with clean data. We
        have started integrating our portfolio of applications with CopyStorm
        since mid 2019. While this service is primarily supported by our vendor
        (Cognizant), a co-worker and I have been involved in the process as an
        learning experience.
